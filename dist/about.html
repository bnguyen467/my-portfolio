          <p>
            My name is Vernon Nguyen and I am a student at UC Irvine Coding
            Bootcamp. I have spent 2 years in Orange Coast College in Business
            major and transfered to CSU Fullerton but, things did not work out
            so well; therefore, I decided to change my major to Computer
            Science.
          </p>
          <p>
            After switching to technology field, I spent all my time to research
            and self-learning. After 3 months of learning C++ and Data
            Structure, I still did not know where to start and I need a solid
            foundation of knowledge, I made my way to UCI Coding Bootcamp.
          </p>

        <div class="skill">
          <h2 class="sm-heading">A Few Skills That I have....</h2>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-1">
          <h2 class="sm-heading">Programming Languages</h2>
          <h3>
            C++, HTML/CSS/SCSS, Javascript, Nodejs, Express, MySQL, MongoDB,
            React
          </h3>
          <p>
            At UCI Bootcamp, they teach us to be a full-stack developer, which
            means, we have to learn every day and keep it as consistent as
            possible, from frontend to backend.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-2">
          <h2 class="sm-heading">Hard Skills</h2>
          <h3>Technical Writing, Mathematics, Problem-solving</h3>
          <p>
            It is the fact that UCI Bootcamp creates a harsh environment to
            educate a student to be a full-stack developer. Thefore these basic
            skills will be naturally improved during the course. Also, it is
            impossible to pass with a perfect A without trying.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="job job-3">
          <h2 class="sm-heading">Soft Skills</h2>
          <h3>
            Teamwork & Cooperation, Communication, Attention to Details,
            Organization
          </h3>
          <p>
            Again, I was forced to work as a group every day during the
            full-stack course. As a result, I realize how important it is to
            work cooperatively.
